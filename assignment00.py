# Assignment 00, STAT 3250

# This assignment is for practice only, the score will not be used.

# Two *very* important rules that must be followed in order for your assignment
# to be graded correctly:

# a) The Python file name must be exactly "assignment00.py" with the correct two digit
# assignment number and without the quotes.
# b) The variables names like q1, q2, ... will be used to grade the assignment.
# They are initially set to `None` but you must set them equal to your final answer.
# If you don't know the answer, leave the variable as `None`.

# Notes:
# The autograder will run your python file in order to grade the q1, q2, ... variables.
# If your code throws an error, then the autograder will not be able to grade it and
# you will receive a zero.
# Before you submit, run your entire file locally to make sure there are no errors.

# Question 1

# Assuming that there are 365 days in year, calculate the number of seconds in one year.

q1 = 60*60*24*365

# Question 2

# A string in Python uses either single or double quotes.
# Create the string with the text: "Hello World" and save it as q2.

q2 = "Hello World"

# Question 3

# A list is created by enclosing comma-separated values by brackets.
# Create a list with "Hello" as the first element and "World" as the second
# element.

q3 = ["Hello", "World"]

# Before you submit, make sure you run the entire Python file locally.
# This can be done by clicking the green arrow at the top in Spyder (F5).
